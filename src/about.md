I'm into a bit of everything. Some might say that makes me attention-deficit - I like to think it gives me the ability to see things from more angles. I'm a huge technology enthusiast, and while I work for (and love working for) one particularly large tech company, my interests are much broader (as you'll see from reading this blog). The opinions here are mine alone.
